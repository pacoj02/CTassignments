Project title: StoryWeaver Test Plan

Introduction:
       Overview: This app is designed for collaborative and sequential storytelling, a digital version of the classic game of Telephone or Mad Libs. 
                    The premise relies purely on user-generated text and imagination, facilitated by a unique set of constraints to make each story unexpected and fun.
       Test Plan Objective: To insure a smooth user interface and game flow without glitches on Latest Android based Operating Systems.
       Scope: We will test users can 1. Register and create a Username that doesnt already exist in the database.
                                     2. Log in
                                     3. Search for Specific Story Tellers or join Random Circles.
                                     4. Join a "Circle" of 4-10 Story Tellers
              We will also test to ensure that the next Story-Teller only recieves the previous sentence and is 
                    allowed to add thier own sentence to coninue the story.
              Finally we will verify the final story gets assembled in the correct order.
